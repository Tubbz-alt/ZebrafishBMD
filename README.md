# ZebrafishBMD: A software program for benchmark dose calculations using toxicity screening data from high-throughput zebrafish assays. 



The ZebrafishBMD program was written by Dr. Dennis Thomas and 
Dr. Harish Shankaran in collaboration with Dr. Katrina Waters, 
at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. 
The program was developed as part of projects funded by the National 
Institutes of Health [P42 ES016465, P30 ES000210] and the 
Environmental Protection Agency [R835168].

## Main Features

The program calculates BMD10 values for 
22 developmental and 2 behavioral endpoints of zebrafish.

## Version

The current version [version 1](/release_version_1) is a Windows 
standalone application that was created using Matlab 2016b. 
 
Software requirements:
Matlab Runtime v. 9.1 (Matlab 2016b) for Windows
